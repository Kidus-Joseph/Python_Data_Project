It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. In object oriented programming, a class encapsulates data and functionality together, allowing you to create instances (objects) that share common properties but also unique characteristics\n","\n","- Class: The blueprint or template\n","- Object: An instance of a class. When you create an object, you're creating something based on the class\n","- Attributes: Variables that store the data related to the class. These are the characteristics of an object.\n","- Methods: Functions defined within a class that define the behaviors or actions of an object\n","\n","In short, a class defines how to build an object, what attributes the object should have, and what it can do.\n","\n","Here are some examples of when you do use a class:\n","\n","- Modeling Real World Objects: Classes can represent real-world entities. For example, if you're working on an inventory system, you could define a Product class with attributes like name, price, and stock\n","\n","- Encapsulation: You can group related data and functions together. For instance, in a class Car, you can have attributes like make, model, and year, and methods like start() and stop()\n","\n","- Reusability: Classes allow you to reuse the same code by creating multiple instances of the class. For instance, if you have a Person class, you can create many Person objects with different names and attributes.\n","\n","- Organizing code for larger projects: In larger programs, classes help break down functionality into more manageable and modular pieces, making the code cleaner, easier to understand, and maintain\n","\n","- Polymorphism: If you want to define methods that can be implemented differentl by different classes, you can use polymorphism. This is useful in scenarios like having a Shape class with methods like area(), and then subclasses Circle and Square area differently\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-o7SOEg8cEvl"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"fCHKpD0xbVes","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576157194,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":172,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class LukesList:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        \"\"\"Initialize an empty list.\"\"\"\n","        self._items = []\n","\n","    def add(self, item):\n","        \"\"\"Add an item to the end of the list.\"\"\"\n","        self._items.append(item)\n","\n","    def __getitem__(self, index):\n","        \"\"\"Retrieve an item by index.\"\"\"\n","        return self._items[index]\n","\n","    def __setitem__(self, index, value):\n","        \"\"\"Set an item at a specific index.\"\"\"\n","        self._items[index] = value\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        \"\"\"Return a string representation of the list.\"\"\"\n","        return str(self._items)\n","\n","    def __len__(self):\n","        \"\"\"Return the length of the list.\"\"\"\n","        return len(self._items)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list = LukesList()"],"metadata":{"id":"bGOkHyFSkDU8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576189271,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":187,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QEy9i6S_kLEk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576198890,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":168,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}},"outputId":"ba6b13a8-76a2-4206-dc9e-ae5b6c4ba9a6"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list.add(\"Data Nerd\")"],"metadata":{"id":"26f1grVKkM2W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576223503,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":171,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list.add(\"Finance\")"],"metadata":{"id":"RKOZxsFIkS23","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576255991,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":182,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(my_list)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"B3pPoYJzkayP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727576267292,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Kidus Joseph","userId":"17397976075261363323"}},"outputId":"afc02f2d-cbf9-499c-f7ff-06780c414df4"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["2"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class BaseSalary:\n","  #__init__ is a predefined method inside of python and python will run the compiler\n","  def __init__(self, base_salary, bonus_rate=0.1, symbol=\"$\"):\n","    self.base_salary = base_salary # Defining the attributes (variables)\n","    self.bonus_rate = bonus_rate\n","    self.symbol = symbol\n","    #Since total and bonus salary must be calculated, you don't need to add them into the argument.
